    @code = is just a graphic thing that will be shown on the top left corner of the notification
    @street = is a string and you can use the function written down to get it (client side obviusly)
    @id = is a random generated id. keep in mind: it must be unique
    @priority = can be 1, 2 or 3 and will show the notification in different types every time
    @position = should be a table containing the 3 axes for the blip and the position
    @blipname = will be the blip name for the blip on the map. You can also not include it to disable the blip on the map
    @color = will be the color for the blip
    @sprite = will be the sprite of the blip
    @fadeOut = will be the time needed to remove the blip from the map (in seconds)
    @duration = will be the time needed to remove the notification from the top right of the screen
    @officer = will be the name of the player calling (or whatever you want)
    @job = is the job that will allow all players with that job to receive this specific notification
